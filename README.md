# Foul Rag
An attempt at literary text parsing.



 > _"Those masterful images because complete <br />
Grew in pure mind, but out of what began? <br />
A mound of refuse or the sweepings of a street, <br />
Old kettles, old bottles, and a broken can, <br />
Old iron, old bones, old rags, that raving slut <br />
Who keeps the till. Now that my ladder's gone, <br />
I must lie down where all the ladders start <br />
In the foul rag and bone shop of the heart."_ <br />
W.B. Yeats <br />
from "The Circus Animals' Dessertion"
